# HelloInterface 
In this Tutorial you will see a very simplified use case for interfaces.
You will learn how to structure a program with interfaces to reduce needed code, while adding modularity.

Master branch:
Includes the task and a basic way to solve it without any objects or interfaces.

Tutorial10 branch:
Adds a few extra tasks to show the tedious work that we try to avoid in future branches.

Tutorial20 branch:
Adds classes that implement an interface to do the same task.

Tutorial30 branch:
Show why the extra work from the last step pays off by adding functionality to the classes, while reducing needed code.

Tutorial40 branch:
Readds the extra tasks from Tutorial10 branch to show how easily you can add "modules" to a program working with interfaces.

Tutorial50 branch:
Outsources the number adding stuff so the main program needs ZERO code changes when new modules are added. Infinite values of all the supported types can be added. Supporting new types is a matter of adding a single line of code and a model.
